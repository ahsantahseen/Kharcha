Kharcha is an basic small expense tracker, it started as an hobby project to get my hands into with Mobile Apps Development. This application is made for Android Devices and supports around 90% of devices.  Realtime Database of Google Firebase is being used as database which updates values in real-time along with basic email and password login.
